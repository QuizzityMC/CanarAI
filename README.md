# CanarAI
The simple, super easily selfhosteable AI-bot for Canary Films

## How to selfhost?
Couldn't be simpler! Simply download index.html - and, well, run it! If you want to host it with your own domain, fork the repository and use it like any github pages site.

## How to use?
Under "Define AI behavior or role" type any prompt for the AI that you want - this is for what the actual AI's character is - how it acts! Then, type your message in one of the three sessions and see your character come to life! Use the sessions simultaneously to get all the answers! (OK I sound like a used car salesman now)
